                          <p id="my-bio">Hi, my name is Ciarra Murphy and I am a full stack web developer. I previously worked at a non-profit where I worked with Wordpress to help post events and news items on our firm’s website. From that, I found that I really enjoyed working behind the scenes on websites and the creativity it allowed me. I decided to follow up with that new interest and enroll in the full stack development program. I’ve learned code like Node, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose and React. I really found myself drawn to the front-end aspect of the course, HTML, CSS design and Javascript. I would like to expand on the work I did on the programs and focus my future in that direction. </p>
